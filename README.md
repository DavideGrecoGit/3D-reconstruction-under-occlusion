# Reconstructing 3D Object Models from RGB Image/Video Data

This project will develop a machine learning model that robustly reconstructs 3D models of objects from 2D (RGB) images and/or videos. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the method will be evaluated using images/videos recorded in different settings, such as illumination change, (self-)occlusion, etc. The project has the following objectives:

1. To explore the use of state-of-the-art 3D object reconstruction models, and compare the performance between the models

2. To explore the feasibility of generating synthetic dataset(s) to simulate different conditions to improve the robustness of the 3D reconstruction model
