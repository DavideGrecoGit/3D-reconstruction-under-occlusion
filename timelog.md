## Week 1

### 20 Sept 2022

- _3 hours_ Read the project guidance notes

## Week 2

### 28 Sept 2022

- _0.5 hour_ Read 3D car shape reconstruction from a contour sketch using GAN and lazy learning paper
- _1.5 hour_ Read Pix2Vox paper
- _1 hour_ Trying to train Pix2Vox using Colab (Not successful)

### 30 Sept 2022

- _1 hour_ Read 3D-R2N2 paper
- _0.5 hour_ Setting up GitLab repository
- _0.5 hour_ Trying to use pre-trained Pix2Vox models using my Laptop (Not successful)
- _0.5 hour_ Meeting with supervisor
- _0.5 hour_ Updating GitLab repository (Creating Issues, First milestone, Labels and writing the meeting's log)
- _1 hour_ Searching for papers that tackle the problem from different views. Found a nice review covering 149 different papers: Han, X., Laga, H. and Bennamoun, M., 2021. Image-Based 3D Object Reconstruction: State-of-the-Art and Trends in the Deep Learning Era. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(5), pp.1578-1604.

## Week 3

### 3 Oct 2022

- _3.5 hours_ Read The paper "Image-Based 3D Object Reconstruction: State-of-the-Art and Trends in the Deep Learning Era."
- _2 hours_ Trying to use pre-trained Pix2Vox models on Colab (Not possible due to lack of space)
- _0.5 hour_ Read about domain randomization
- _1.5 hour_ Read Occupancy Networks: Learning 3D Reconstruction in Function Space

### 4 Oct 2022

- _1.5 hour_ Meeting preparation (writing down questions, possible ideas to pursue and salient information I found reading papers)
- _1.5 hour_ Exploring the literature looking for 3D object generation using GANs (SDF-StyleGAN seems promising)
- _1 hour_ Exploring the literature looking for 2D image generation using Gans (StyleGAN-XL seems promising)

### 5 Oct 2022

- _1 hour_ Making notes of "Image-Based 3D Object Reconstruction: State-of-the-Art and Trends in the Deep Learning"
